                If your reports are within normal range, it is certainly good news. But normal results do not always give you a clean bill of health. If symptoms persist, your doctor will recommend other tests to detect what is triggering the unusual signs.

                Utmost care is taken to collect samples while maintaining complete hygiene.
                 Only new and fresh collection kits and needles are used. After collection,
                  the sample is immediately transferred into an icebox to prevent degradation 
                  and bacterial build-up which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis. The samples
                   are barcode tagged to prevent mix up and in the laboratories, technicians use
                    high-end, state-of-the-art devices to analyse the samples.

                Lab tests or diagnostic tests are recommended by doctors when they suspect 
                that there might be something wrong with your health. Samples of your blood,
                 stool, urine, or mucus can reveal a lot about the state of your health when
                  analysed with special devices. Once the problem is detected, your doctor
                 can diagnose and put you on medication or suggest a course of treatment.

                  you may need to consume food before the sample is collected.
                   Speak with your doctor regarding what you need to do to prepare for a 
                lab test. Let your doctor know if you are already on any medication.
